# Future Prompt Ideas

These are early thoughts on additional storytelling prompts we might include in future releases:

- Questions about childhood traditions and family rituals.
- Reflections on important mentors or role models.
- Descriptions of memorable trips or adventures.
- Space for attaching letters or documents.
- Prompts that encourage users to share hopes for future generations.

These notes are placeholders and will be expanded with real content as the app evolves.
